# Developer Guide

frp-rs is a native Rust implementation of [frp](https://github.com/fatedier/frp), a reverse proxy that exposes services on private networks to the public internet. This guide covers the development workflow for contributors.

Topic map — this guide deliberately does **not** restate the others:

## 1. Workspace at a glance

Six crates in a layered graph; dependencies flow **upward** (binaries → logic
crates → `frp-core`, which has no internal workspace dependencies):

```
frps ──► frp-server ──► frp-core        frpc ──► frp-client ──► frp-core
             │                                              │
             └──► frp-vnet ─────────────────────────────────►┘
```

`frp-server` / `frp-client` hold the protocol logic but no `main()`; the
binaries live in `frps/` and `frpc/`. Full crate-by-crate responsibilities and
the annotated module tree: [architecture.md § Overview](architecture.md#overview)
and [§ Project Structure](architecture.md#project-structure).

## 2. Adding a New Proxy Type

This section walks through adding a new proxy type called `myproxy`:

### Step 1: Config Parsing (if needed)

If the new proxy type requires new config fields, add them to the proxy config struct in `frp-core/src/config/`. Existing proxy config fields are shared across all proxy types in `ProxyConfig` -- if your proxy type reuses those fields, no config changes are needed.

### Step 2: Register in ProxyManager

In `frp-server/src/control/proxy_ops.rs`, the `handle_new_proxy` function registers proxies in `ProxyManager`. Most proxy types reuse the existing registration logic. If your proxy type needs special registration:

- **Port allocation**: the function already handles port allocation via `allocate_port_multi()`. SUDP proxies get special shared-port handling.
- **sk_index**: STCP/XTCP proxies register in `sk_index` for secret-key routing. Add your proxy type here if it uses sk-based routing.
- **VHost routing**: HTTP/HTTPS proxies register in `VhostManager`. Add your proxy type here if it uses domain-based routing.
- **TcpMux routing**: TCPMux proxies register in `TcpMuxManager`.

### Step 3: Add Listener Setup

In `frp-server/src/control/proxy_ops.rs`, after proxy registration, the function spawns a listener task. The existing `listen_and_proxy()` helper starts TCP listeners for tcp/http/https/stcp/tcpmux proxy types. UDP proxies use `listen_and_proxy_udp()`.

For a new proxy type that needs a different listener pattern:
1. Add a branch in the proxy type match after registration
2. Spawn a `tokio::spawn` task that binds a `TcpListener` on the allocated port
3. On accept, send `InternalMsg::ProxyUserConn` with the user connection and pre-read bytes

Example pattern (simplified from existing code):

```rust
let listener = TcpListener::bind(&addr).await?;
let internal_tx_clone = internal_tx.clone();
tokio::spawn(async move {
    loop {
        match listener.accept().await {
            Ok((stream, _)) => {
                let _ = internal_tx_clone.send(InternalMsg::ProxyUserConn {
                    proxy_name: name.clone(),
                    user_conn: IoStream::Tcp(stream),
                    pre_read: vec![],
                });
            }
            Err(_) => break,
        }
    }
});
```

### Step 4: Implement Bridging Logic

The bridging is handled automatically by the control handler's `InternalMsg::ProxyUserConn` path -- it pops a work connection from the pool, sends `StartWorkConn`, and bridges. No special bridging code is needed for basic TCP-like proxy types.

If your proxy type needs special bridging (e.g., HTTP host header rewriting, protocol-specific framing), add the logic in `frp-server/src/control/bridge.rs`. The existing `assign_work_to_proxy` function handles plain vs encrypted bridging and pre-read byte forwarding.

For the client side, proxy type handling is in `frp-client/src/service.rs` and `frp-client/src/work_conn.rs` -- the client reads `StartWorkConn` to know which local service to connect to.

## 3. Building and Feature Flags

### Quick Reference

```bash
cargo build                  # Debug build (all crates)
cargo build --release        # Release build (opt-level=z, LTO, panic=abort)
cargo test --workspace       # Run all tests
cargo clippy                 # Lint
```

### Binary Variants

Four size tiers via feature flags. The authoritative tier list, exact commands
and measured binary sizes live in the README —
[**Binary Variants**](../README.md#binary-variants). The resulting binaries are
named `frps`/`frpc` (default/full), `frps-tiny`/`frpc-tiny`, and
`frps-micro`/`frpc-micro`.

### Feature Flags

The authoritative flag table — every feature, the crate it belongs to, what it
removes, which are default-ON, and which are opt-in/dev-only — is
[**CLAUDE.md § Binary Variants**](../CLAUDE.md#binary-variants). It is not
duplicated here.

Which crates are vendored (and why, and when each can be dropped) is in
[**README § Vendored crates**](../README.md#vendored-crates).

### Release Profile

```toml
# Cargo.toml
[profile.release]
opt-level = "z"       # Optimize for size
lto = "fat"           # Link-time optimization across all crates
codegen-units = 1     # Single codegen unit for better optimization
strip = "symbols"     # Strip debug symbols
panic = "abort"       # Abort on panic (smaller binary, no unwind tables)
```

After `cargo build --release`, further compress with UPX:

```bash
upx --best --lzma target/release/frps target/release/frpc
```

## 4. Debugging

### RUST_LOG Levels

The project uses `tracing` for structured logging. Available levels: `error`, `warn`, `info`, `debug`, `trace`.

```bash
# Debug logging for everything
RUST_LOG=debug cargo run --bin frps -- -c frps.toml

# Target-specific logging
RUST_LOG=frp_server::control=debug cargo run --bin frps -- -c frps.toml

# Trace-level for wire protocol inspection
RUST_LOG=frp_core::protocol=trace cargo run --bin frps -- -c frps.toml

# Multiple targets
RUST_LOG=frp_server=debug,frp_core::protocol=trace cargo run --bin frps -- -c frps.toml
```

Key tracing targets:
- `frp_core::protocol` -- V1 frame writes (`trace` level includes full JSON payloads)
- `frp_server::service` -- connection accept, TLS handshake, dispatch
- `frp_server::control` -- control handler lifecycle, internal message routing, heartbeat
- `frp_server::control::bridge` -- work connection bridging
- `frp_core::transport` -- connection type detection, magic byte stripping
- `frp_server::nathole` -- NAT hole punch session lifecycle
- `frp_client::service` -- client lifecycle, proxy registration
- `frp_client::work_conn` -- work connection management

### Inspecting Wire Protocol

Enable trace-level logging for `frp_core::protocol` to see every frame sent and received:

```bash
RUST_LOG=frp_core::protocol=trace cargo run --bin frps -- -c frps.toml
```

This outputs the type byte, payload length, and full JSON content for each V1 frame. For hex dumps of the raw bytes, use an external tool like `tcpdump` or `wireshark`:

```bash
# Capture frp traffic on loopback
sudo tcpdump -i lo -A -s 0 port 7000

# Capture with hex dump
sudo tcpdump -i lo -X -s 0 port 7000
```

### Common Issues

**"Connection reset by peer" on startup:**
- Check that `bind_port` is not already in use
- Verify the server and client `token` match
- Check that `server_addr` is reachable from the client

**Proxy connections time out:**
- Check `heartbeat_timeout` -- client must ping within this interval
- Check `pool_count` -- if too low, proxy connections queue and expire after 10s
- Verify firewall allows traffic on proxy ports

**Enrypted bridge corruption:**
- Both sides must agree on `use_encryption` and `use_compression`
- The encryption key derives from the auth token -- mismatched tokens = corrupted bridge

**TLS handshake failures:**
- TLS requires valid cert/key files (`tls_cert_file`, `tls_key_file`)
- When `tls_only` is true, non-TLS connections are rejected
- WebSocket over TLS requires the client to connect with `wss://` and `transport_protocol = "wss"`

**XTCP hole punch failures:**
- Both provider and visitor need public internet access for STUN
- Symmetric NAT on both sides usually prevents hole punching -- STCP fallback is needed
- Check that `sk` is set and identical on both provider and visitor proxies

## 5. Testing

### What a green test run does and does not prove

Read this before quoting a test count as evidence of compatibility. It is the
single easiest mistake to make in this repository.

**Hard evidence — these compare frp-rs against a real Go frp binary:**

| Gate | What it establishes |
|---|---|
| `scripts/compat-test.sh` — 86 scenarios + 17 XTCP pairwise, vs Go frp v0.71.0 | Wire and behavioural parity with the reference implementation |
| `scripts/protocol-matrix.sh` — 11 transport rows | Data actually moves through frps+frpc for every transport / encryption / mux combination |
| Daily `xtcp-compat.yml` on a VPS | XTCP hole punching against Go frpc across a real NAT |

**Proxy evidence — the ~2000 unit and integration tests:**

They pin *frp-rs's own* behaviour. That is genuinely valuable (they catch
regressions, and most were written by reading Go's source), but a passing suite
does **not** establish Go parity, because a test encodes the author's *model* of
Go's behaviour — and that model can be wrong.

This is not hypothetical. The project's own history records it, repeatedly:

- **Round 4**: "the slowloris ponging test was RED — the round-3 claim was
  wrong". The test assumed yamux's ping frame tag was `4`; it is `2`. A whole
  round's confidence rested on a test that was failing.
- **Round 16**: the round-15 suite "encoded a **FALSE `SplitHostPort` claim**".
  All three oracles in `vhost.rs` and `vhost_h2c.rs` had to be flipped once Go's
  `net/ipsock.go:216` was actually read.
- **Round 16**: "two round-14/15-era tests that pinned the trim behaviour [were]
  flipped".
- **Round 6**: a stale pin in `server_protocol.rs:81` — a target-only test run
  was blind to the integration file that held the real expectation.
- **Round 7**: a round-9-era "established reject policy" pin turned out to rest
  on a false premise; the expectation was flipped after probing the real
  Go 1.25.12 binary.
- **Round 9** returned a verdict of "production code healthy, **test
  completeness below standard**" while **1253 tests were green**.
- **Round 9** also surfaced that the shared test fixture kept
  `authentication_timeout = 0`, so replay protection — the thing under test —
  was never exercised at all.

**The practical rules:**

1. A green suite means "no *known* regression", not "compatible with Go frp".
2. Before claiming a compatibility fix, cite Go source (`file:line`) or a probe
   of the real binary — not a passing test.
3. When a test expectation is the *only* thing asserting a behaviour, say so.
   That is a hypothesis, not evidence.
4. For a parity claim, prefer adding a `compat-test.sh` scenario over another
   unit test.

### Unit Tests

Unit tests live inline in `#[cfg(test)] mod tests` blocks within source files. Integration tests live in the `frp-server/tests/` and `frp-client/tests/` directories (see "Writing New Tests" below).

```bash
# Run all tests
cargo test --workspace

# Run tests for a specific crate
cargo test -p frp-core
cargo test -p frp-server
cargo test -p frp-client

# Run a specific test by name
cargo test -p frp-core -- protocol::tests

# Run with output (show println! and tracing)
cargo test -- --nocapture

# Run ignored tests (e.g., tests requiring network access)
cargo test -- --ignored
```

### Cross-Compatibility Tests

The compat test suite verifies Go frp <-> Rust frp interop across all proxy types and transport protocols:

```bash
# Full suite (86 run_test scenarios, 2 of which are gated on Go frp V2)
bash scripts/compat-test.sh --verbose

# Filter by proxy type and direction
bash scripts/compat-test.sh tcp g2r     # TCP proxy, Go client -> Rust server
bash scripts/compat-test.sh xtcp        # All XTCP tests
bash scripts/compat-test.sh transport   # Transport protocol tests only

# Filter by direction
bash scripts/compat-test.sh g2r         # All Go->Rust tests
bash scripts/compat-test.sh r2g         # All Rust->Go tests
```

The compat tests require Go frp binaries. Download them first:

```bash
bash scripts/download-go-frp.sh
```

This downloads Go frp v0.71.0 binaries to `scripts/go-frp/`. The CI gate is `.github/workflows/compat.yml`.

### XTCP CI Tests

XTCP tests require public internet (for STUN) and run on a VPS:

```bash
# Setup VPS (one-time)
bash scripts/vps-setup.sh

# Run XTCP tests on VPS
bash scripts/remote-frps.sh xtcp
```

XTCP CI uses sharded matrix jobs (`.github/workflows/xtcp-compat.yml`) with per-shard directories for isolation. 17 tests covering the 2x2 implementation matrix (Go/Rust server × Go/Rust client) plus QUIC-data-plane and encrypted variants.

### Writing New Tests

Follow these conventions:

1. **Inline tests**: add to the relevant source file's `#[cfg(test)] mod tests`
2. **Integration tests**: add to `frp-server/tests/` or `frp-client/tests/`
3. **Use `test_utils`**: each crate may provide test helpers for spawning servers/clients
4. **Avoid port conflicts**: use port `0` for auto-allocation or pick unique ports
5. **Clean up**: ensure spawned tasks/processes are killed on test completion

### Benchmarks

Criterion micro-benchmarks in `frp-core/benches/crypto_bridge.rs` (8 groups) and `frp-server/benches/nathole.rs` (2 groups):

```bash
# Run all benchmarks (slow — runs each bench many times)
cargo bench -p frp-core
cargo bench -p frp-server

# Quick compile-time check (used in CI)
cargo bench --workspace --no-run

# Run specific groups
cargo bench -p frp-core -- protocol_all_types
cargo bench -p frp-core -- bridge
cargo bench -p frp-server -- nat_analysis
```

CI gate: `cargo bench --workspace --no-run` in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` ensures benchmarks don't bit-rot.

### Stress Tests

Long-running load test (`scripts/stress-test.sh`) that runs frps + frpc under connection churn:

```bash
bash scripts/stress-test.sh
```

Monitors memory, connection counts, and throughput. Runs weekly in CI via `.github/workflows/stress-test.yml`. The `scripts/frp-stress/` crate contains the load generator (not part of the main workspace).

### Property & Fuzz Tests

Proptest-based tests verify correctness under adversarial inputs:
- **Config normalization** (`frp-core/src/config/`): 9 proptest! blocks — idempotency, flat↔nested equivalence, camelCase→snake_case
- **Protocol fuzzing** (`frp-core/src/protocol.rs`): 6 fuzz tests + 35 regular tests — all 256 V1 type bytes × arbitrary payloads, V2 arbitrary type IDs, truncated frames, magic detection

## 6. Release Process

### Version Bumping

**frp-rs 自身版本号严格对齐 Go frp 的发布号** (mandatory): the version
equals the current compat target Go frp release — currently **0.71.0** — and
bumps only when Go frp releases a new number. Update the version in ALL
sync locations:

```bash
# All crates share the same version
# Update in:
#   Cargo.toml (workspace)
#   frp-core/Cargo.toml
#   frp-server/Cargo.toml
#   frp-client/Cargo.toml
#   frps/Cargo.toml
#   frpc/Cargo.toml
#   frp-core/src/lib.rs  (VERSION constant)
#   scripts/download-frp-rs.sh  (default version)
#   README.md
```

Exception: `frp-vnet` stays independent at `0.1.0`.

### Building Release Binaries

The release workflow (`.github/workflows/release.yml`) cross-compiles for 13 targets:

- **Linux**: x86_64, aarch64, armv7, arm, i686, riscv64gc — glibc builds for all six, musl only for x86_64/aarch64/armv7 (built with `cargo zigbuild`)
- **macOS**: x86_64, aarch64 -- native builds
- **Windows**: x86_64, aarch64 -- native builds

Each target produces three variants: full, tiny, and micro.

To build locally for your platform:

```bash
# Full
cargo build --release -p frps -p frpc

# Tiny
cargo build --release -p frps -p frpc --no-default-features --features tiny

# Micro
cargo build --release -p frps -p frpc --no-default-features --features micro
```

### UPX Compression

After building, compress with UPX for additional size reduction (optional):

```bash
upx --best --lzma target/release/frps target/release/frpc
```

UPX is not required -- the release profile already produces compact binaries via `opt-level=z`, `lto=fat`, and `strip=symbols`.

### Docker Image Publication

The Docker image is built from source in a multi-stage build (`docker/Dockerfile.source`):

```bash
# Build for frps (from repo root)
docker build --build-arg FRP_COMPONENT=frps -t frps:latest -f docker/Dockerfile.source .

# Build for frpc
docker build --build-arg FRP_COMPONENT=frpc -t frpc:latest -f docker/Dockerfile.source .
```

Also available: `frps-tiny`, `frpc-tiny`, `frps-micro`, `frpc-micro` variants. The release workflow (`.github/workflows/docker.yml`) builds and pushes multi-arch images for all 6 variants. The image uses a `scratch` base (~2 MB total) with a musl-static binary.

### Triggering a Release

Releases are triggered by pushing a version tag or manually via workflow dispatch:

```bash
# Tag and push (triggers .github/workflows/release.yml)
git tag v0.71.0
git push origin v0.71.0
```

The release workflow:
1. Builds all 13 targets (9 Linux via cargo-zigbuild + 2 macOS + 2 Windows)
2. Packages each as `.tar.gz` (Linux/macOS) or `.zip` (Windows)
3. Creates a GitHub Release with auto-generated notes
4. Uploads all artifacts

The Docker workflow runs separately (`.github/workflows/docker.yml`) and can be triggered manually or on release.

## Dependency Policy

The dependency policy — the pre-approved tech stack table, the banned list and
the justification each new crate must carry — is maintained in exactly one
place: [**CLAUDE.md § Dependency Policy**](../CLAUDE.md#dependency-policy-mandatory).

It is not duplicated here because a second copy drifts: the copy that used to
live in this file had already fallen behind (it listed four vendored `yamux`
patches when there are five, and its TLS row omitted the pointer to
`vendor/rustls/README-FRP-RS.md`).

Adding a dependency: declare it in the workspace `[workspace.dependencies]`
table in the root `Cargo.toml`, then reference it by name (no version) from the
sub-crate.
