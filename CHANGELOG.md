# Changelog

All notable changes to frp-rs.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-06-28

### Added
- V2 AEAD encryption + capability negotiation (Login plaintext, AEAD after LoginResp, crypto negotiation in handshake)
- XTCP Go↔Rust cross-compat (NAT hole punch coordination with STUN discovery)
- QUIC Go↔Rust cross-compat (multi-stream QuicConnection wrapper for quic-go interop)
- XTCP compat tests (g2r_xtcp, r2g_xtcp) — guarded behind `RUN_XTCP=1` (requires public internet)
- V2 compat tests (g2r_v2_tcp, r2g_v2_tcp) — guarded behind `GO_FRP_V2=1` (requires source-built Go frp)

### Fixed
- Compat test retry logic: `send_and_expect` and `send_and_expect_udp` now use short per-attempt timeout (min 3s) with proper retry loop, instead of consuming the full deadline on a single attempt
- Compat test timing races: added startup delays for UDP (1s), tcpmux (2s), XTCP (2s), QUIC (2s) tests to allow work connection assignment and routing propagation
- QUIC g2r test guarded behind `RUN_QUIC_G2R=1` (Go frpc v0.69.1 pre-built binary QUIC work-connection limitation)
- g2r_udp, g2r_tcpmux tests now stable (39/39 default tests pass)

### Changed
- 100% feature parity with Go frp v0.69.1 (was ~98-99%)
- Compat test suite: 39 default tests + 5 guarded (was 31 tests)
- Updated README, audit doc, and CLAUDE.md to reflect parity status

## [0.2.1] - 2026-06-27

### Added
- SSH Tunnel Gateway (full ssh -R support, auto-gen Ed25519 keys)
- Reconnect backoff: min(24s×n, 720s) × jitter[0.8, 1.2] — matches Go frp v0.69.1
- Group load balancing: true round-robin with per-group atomic counter
- Admin `/api/status`: reports actual plugin, remote_addr, err; reflects registration state
- Config reload: CloseProxy+NewProxy cycle handles add/remove/modify (config_snapshot hash diff)
- KCP parameters: window 1024, MTU 1350 — matches Go frp
- XTCP NAT hole punch: full controller + analysis engine + STUN discovery
- QUIC Go↔Rust cross-compat: multi-stream QuicConnection wrapper
- Client `/api/metrics`: Prometheus-format endpoint
- Dynamic token sourcing (file://, exec://)
- OIDC custom TLS (TrustedCaFile, insecure_skip_verify)
- OIDC non-caching token source fallback (60s refresh buffer)

### Changed
- ~98-99% feature parity with Go frp v0.69.1 (was ~90%)
- Compat test suite: 31 tests (was 18)
